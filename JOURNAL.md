I spent the entire day researching and brainstorming my project idea. I explored its merits, how I could improve it, what features I could add, and any drawbacks I might encounter, as well as ways to reduce or avoid them altogether. I also researched the best design methods and the most appropriate component prices to adhere to the budget and use the grant as responsibly as possible.

I worked for around **5 hours** on idea validation and cost optimization to make sure I can build the best version of the project with the least possible cost.

Because my experience with schematics and PCB design was intermediate, I took some time to watch tutorials and improve my skills. Then I started designing the schematic. Choosing the right components and connecting everything correctly was a challenge and required a lot of effort.

I also shared screenshots of my schematic on the Hack Club Slack platform for feedback and to discuss possible improvements.

 I spent around **6 hours** today designing and iterating on the schematic.

Today, I converted my sketch to a PCB layout and started setting up the wires.

 I ran DRC (Design Rule Check) and found 8 errors. It took a long time to fix each one, but eventually, I brought the error count to zero.

After that, I began designing the 3D case for the project, carefully aligning all component placements and checking for any last-minute improvements before finalizing everything.

I worked for about **9 hours** today to make sure the PCB and case design are ready for building as soon as possible.
