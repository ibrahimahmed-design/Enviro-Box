I spent the whole day researching and brainstorming around the idea of my project. I explored its advantages, how I could improve it, what features I could add, and what drawbacks I might face — along with ways to reduce or completely avoid them. I also looked into the best design approaches and searched for the most affordable component prices to stay within budget and use the grant as responsibly as possible.  
I worked for around **13 hours** on idea validation and cost optimization to make sure I can build the best version of the project with the least possible cost.

Since my experience with schematic and PCB design was average, I took some time to watch tutorials and improve my skills. Then, I started designing the schematic. Choosing the right components and wiring everything correctly was really challenging and took a lot of effort.  
I also shared screenshots of my schematic on the Hack Club Slack to get feedback and discuss potential improvements. I spent around **12 hours** today designing and iterating on the schematic.

Today, I converted my schematic into a PCB layout and started adjusting the traces. I ran DRC (Design Rule Check) and found 8 errors. It took a long time to debug and fix each issue, but eventually, I brought the error count to zero.  
After that, I began designing the 3D case for the project, carefully aligning all component placements and checking for any last-minute improvements before finalizing everything.  
I worked for about **15 hours** today to make sure the PCB and case design are ready for building as soon as possible.
