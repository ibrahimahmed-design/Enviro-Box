# EnviroBox

**EnviroBox** Is A smart, open-source, portable device designed to monitor indoor air quality in real time without an internet connection. Ideal for classrooms and homes. It features a visual and audible alarm system when fault indicators are detected.
## üåü Overview

EnviroBox measures:
- **CO‚ÇÇ (Carbon Dioxide)**
- **PM2.5 (Fine Dust Particles)**
- **CO (Carbon Monoxide)**
- **Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure**

 Data is displayed on a screen. When dangerous levels are detected, it activates both visual (RGB LEDs) and audible (buzzer) alarms.

 The device works by connecting it to a power bank or battery via USB Type-C.

## üß† Why it Matters

Indoor air quality has a huge impact on focus, health, and wellbeing‚Äîespecially in schools and densely populated areas.  
Commercial solutions are often expensive and closed-source.

EnviroBox offers:
- An affordable, DIY alternative.
- Open-source code and schematics.
- Educational value for students and makers.
